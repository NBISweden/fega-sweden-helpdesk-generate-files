# fega-sweden-helpdesk-generate-files

Snakemake workflow to generate artificial files in FASTQ format for testing
purposes. This workflow ensures that the files not only are given unique
filenames, but also that the sequence identifiers within the files are unique
(the generated files should thus have different checksums).

By providing a prefix to the filenames and sequence identifiers, you can also
ensure that files differ between runs. The workflow will use a timestamp as
prefix by default. Four files will be generated by default.


## Prerequisites

* Python 3
* Snakemake


## Usage

For running the workflow on a single core with default settings:

```
snakemake -c 1
```

Output files will be stored in a folder named `output/`.

If you want to generate for example 20 files, you can enter the following 
command:

```
snakemake -c 1 --config numFiles=20
```

You can also provide a custom prefix to be used in filenames and
sequence identifiers:

```
snakemake -c 1 --config prefix="submission1_" numFiles=20
```
